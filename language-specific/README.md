# Language-Specific Resources

This section of the playbook provides dedicated resources, templates, and tools tailored for specific programming languages. Each language subsection includes file templates and prompts designed to help you produce code that aligns with Defra's development standards. These materials are crafted to streamline your workflow and ensure compliance with best practices. As our tools and standards evolve, this section is regularly updated to reflect the latest guidelines and improvements. We encourage you to check back frequently to stay up-to-date with the most recent changes and enhancements.

## IDE Configuration Files

Both [Cursor](../tool-specific/tool-cursor.md) and [Windsurf](../tool-specific/tool-windsurf.md) instruct the LLM on how to write code in a way that is consistent.

Cursor saves the rules files in the repository in the `.cursor/rules` directory.  Windsurf has a single rule file in the root of the repository called `.windsurfrules`
