# Feature Development Lifecycle
Ready to build something amazing with AI? This section walks you through the practical steps of developing features using AI tools as your coding partner.

**Important prerequisite:** You should have already completed the [Core Concepts](../2-core-concepts/). It is crucial that you have configured proper privacy settings as outlined in the [Project Setup](../2-core-concepts/2.3-project-setup.md) section. This keeps your sensitive information safe when working with AI tools.

## Why follow this lifecycle?

As developers, we've all been there - staring at a blank editor wondering where to start, or battling with code that just won't cooperate. AI tools can help at every stage, but only if you approach them with the right process.

Following this structured lifecycle will help you:

- **Save time** on repetitive coding tasks
- **Improve quality** by generating consistent, well-tested code
- **Learn faster** by seeing how AI approaches different problems
- **Build confidence** in your AI-assisted workflow

## The Feature Development Process

This lifecycle breaks down feature development into five practical stages. Each builds on the previous and helps you create production-ready code with AI assistance:

### [3.1 Product Requirements](3.1-product-requirements.md)
Define what you're building clearly - the better you explain what you need to the AI, the better its output will be. Learn how to craft requirements that both humans and AI can understand.

### [3.2 Development](3.2-development.md)
Write code efficiently with AI pair programming. Discover practical techniques for generating, reviewing, and iteratively improving code with tools like Cursor or GitHub Copilot.

### [3.3 Testing](3.3-testing.md)
Generate tests that actually catch bugs. Learn how to prompt AI to create comprehensive test suites and identify edge cases you might have missed.

### [3.4 Refactoring](3.4-refactoring.md)
Improve your code's quality and performance. See how AI can help spot inefficiencies and suggest improvements without breaking existing functionality.

### [3.5 Documentation](3.5-documentation.md)
Create clear, useful documentation without the usual pain. Learn how AI can help document your code, APIs, and processes in a fraction of the usual time.

## Pro tip
Each stage has practical examples and copy-paste prompts you can adapt to your specific projects. Start with a small feature to get comfortable with the process before tackling larger components.
