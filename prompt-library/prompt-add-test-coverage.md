```
For this missing test coverage report:

[paste coverage report line here]

1. If a test file already exists for this file, run this test file only - verify the test itself is correct
2. If not test file exists, create a new one with ONLY the coverage tests needed.  Add tests for a single block of lines at a time.
3. Note that if this is a plugin, then the tests need to be in the `tests` folder of the plugin itself, if not, then the tests should go in the `tests` folder of the root of the application.
4. Think through mocking strategy, follow the existing testing conventions in the code, and only add tests for the missing lines of coverage.
5. Provide complete implementation (no placeholders)
6. Make sure you understand the functionality being tested BEFORE writing the tests.  Think step by step and plan your changes.
7. Don't change the source file, only fix the test file issues
8. Run tests to confirm/verify the fix
9. Fix any warnings, if there are any
10. run the full tests to see if you've addressed all the coverage for the given file
11. only finish working once you've verified there is full coverage, the tests pass, and there are no warnings

**Important:** Provide the final test code as a single, complete snippet that satisfies all requirements on the first try. Do not provide multiple revisions or partial code—just the single final version. If you need to reason internally, do so silently.
