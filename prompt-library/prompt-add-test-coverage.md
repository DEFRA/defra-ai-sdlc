Please improve test coverage for the classifications API endpoints and the dependent modules listed below.  

## Current Coverage  
1. These are the coverage reports for modules have missing coverage
Name                                           Stmts   Miss  Cover   Missing
src/repositories/classification_repo.py           70     18    74%   44-56, 72, 77, 83, 97-99

## Implemention steps
1. First check the actual routes in src/api/v1/classifications.py  
  
2. Review existing tests in tests/integration/test_classifications_api.py 

3. Add missing test scenarios ONLY for existing functionality:
- Focus on error cases and edge cases for the 3 existing routes  
- Do not add tests for non-existent routes/functionality  
  
4. Follow project testing standards from .cursor/rules/02_testing.mdc:  
- Given-When-Then pattern  
- Mock database operations appropriately  
- Use existing test utilities and fixtures  
  
5. Copy existing integration tests patterns and conventions in test_classifications_api.py
- Improve test coverage in but do so using integration tests that test API's and mock external dependencies 

Add tests only to improve coverage of existing code paths.
```

Follow up: 

```
this is the coverage report now:
src/repositories/classification_repo.py 70 18 74% 44-56, 72, 77, 83, 97-99  
  
Analyse @classification_repo.py - does it actually need the code for the lines that are missing - should we refactor?  
  
Or are we still missing some integreation tests in @test_classifications_api.py?
