# Prompt Library

This library provides a curated selection of prompts to optimise your use of AI tools in the development workflow. These examples serve as guidelines that you can adapt to your specific project needs rather than using them verbatim.

## Best Practices
- Refer to [Prompting Guidance](prompting-guidance.md) for detailed guidance on writing effective prompts
- Tailor prompts to your project's specific requirements
- Iterate and refine prompts based on results
