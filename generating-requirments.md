# Generating Requirements
The recipies for successful feature development is always the same.
- Clear requirements
- GDS focussed designs and interfaces
- Clean and clear architectural decisions

AI lacks human judgement and experience.
Which means these requirements are even more important now than ever before.

The goal of this section is to make sure you have sufficient context that all ambiguity is removed from the LLM.
Think of this as Context Building. One of the core aspects of Prompt Engineers.

Every team will be different.
None of this is presecriptive
It's just a bunch of things you might find useful.

Maybe your team already has well documented designs and user stories.
Or maybe you're working as a generalist and you need help creating your prototype.
Pick and choose what from this section based on what you need.

But don't even think of moving onto development until you're satisfied that your documentation has removed all ambiguity for the LLM.

# Product Requirements
- General brain dump
- PRD
- User stories

# Technical Requirements
- Brain dump a high level architecture diagram
- Then iterate through as many other diagrams as you need (e.g. etc)
- Consolodate all your docs at the end
