```
Look at the @workflow-product-requirements.md file and, as per the instructions in the @playbook-refactoring.mdc and @playbook-style-guide.mdc rules and make improvements as instructed. Be sure to only make targeted edits and verify any text you remove to ensure the original intent is preserved. I know it's monday, but you need to try really hard, so we we get the 1 billion pound bonus at the end of the week.
