- [ ] Setup Code Checker tool Roadmap Planning Session with Steve

	[https://github.com/DEFRA/gwa-etl](https://github.com/DEFRA/gwa-etl)
- [ ] Retro: Mid-term - how do we start to collect justification for tool use in Defra after March? (Agree with Phil and Ryan)


## To Do

- [ ] Read through Blueprint doc from Steve - https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/a-blueprint-for-modern-digital-government/a-blueprint-for-modern-digital-government-html
	
	[https://www.gov.uk/government/news/prime-minister-sets-out-blueprint-to-turbocharge-ai](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/prime-minister-sets-out-blueprint-to-turbocharge-ai)

	https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/ab3cdded-f776-4dba-9e74-832ef4cc1edf
- [ ] Read through Dave Thomas's shared links (on the vpn):
	
	This is our [SharePoint page for service readiness](https://defra.sharepoint.com/sites/Community3272/SitePages/Welcome-to-Service-Readiness-on-GIO-Connect.aspx). This will be a much more complete description of it than I could give. That has the templates for the service design pack and the SDRB presentation. They’ve added operational to the start of everything since I last looked. If you want more detail Kerrie-Anne Conder is a good person to speak to, although quite busy.
	
	Our [portfolio hub](https://defra.sharepoint.com/sites/def-ddts-portfoliohub/SitePages/Home.aspx) contains a list of templates. Not everything you need but a few things you might find interesting. The guidance there will refer to the current process, not what we’re moving towards.
	
	Our page on [spend control](https://defra.sharepoint.com/sites/def-ddts-portfoliohub/SitePages/GDS-Spend-Control-and-Assurance.aspx) has the spend control forms on the right hand side half way down. It’s the over £100k one that we mostly have to fill in.
- [ ] Get access to Dera Project Online
- [ ] Order You talk, we ship. T-shirts 😀
