# Core Concepts

Getting reliable results from AI tools starts with a few essential principles. This section introduces foundational ideas for AI-assisted coding and offers a structured approach to development. You'll learn practical techniques that shift your experience from frustration to real productivity gains.

In this section, we’ll explore:
- How to structure your development process so AI tools can meaningfully support your work  
- Simple setup tricks that help AI understand your codebase more effectively  
- Real-world examples showing the before-and-after impact of thoughtful AI integration  

These core ideas give you a reliable framework for developing, testing, and improving AI-powered solutions.

By applying these concepts, your team can confidently bring AI into daily development—producing maintainable code, improving quality, and simplifying complex workflows. The approach emphasises iteration, feedback, and continuous learning to help you get the most out of AI in the SDLC.
