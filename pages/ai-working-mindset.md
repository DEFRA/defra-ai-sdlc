# AI Working Mindset

### AI Problem Solving Mentality

Think of AI as a helpful assistant that you collaborate with, not something you hand off to. 

Solve problems by collaborating with AI. Prompts are the start of a collaborative process, not a one-off instruction.  

Don't be tempted to hand off to the AI. Break large problems into small problems and work closely on them. Review everything - you're still responsible for anything generated by AI.

### Embrace the Fun and Creativity of AI

Working with AI tools combines productivity with creativity. Teams can rapidly develop production-quality features in novel ways, driving continuous exploration and innovation.

You need to adapt beyond traditional development mindsets to effectively work with LLMs.

### A Generalist Approach to Collaboration

AI development shifts from role-based workflows to a generalist mindset. Team members must work across product, design, development and testing. While domain expertise remains valuable, you need adaptability across disciplines for accelerated AI-driven development.

### Managing Cognitive Load

AI tools create unique challenges:
- High cognitive load from rapid experimentation
- Frequent context switching
- Risk of change fatigue

Reduce these through:
- Regular pairing sessions
- Structured breaks
- Clear priorities
- Supportive team culture

### Keeping Current

The AI ecosystem evolves rapidly with daily updates to models, IDEs, and services. Set aside time to track developments and maintain continuous learning. This research time can provide valuable breaks from intensive development.

### Effective Prompting

Clear communication with LLMs is essential. They are highly capable but they have no context. Well-crafted prompts give better results. Iterate on prompts to improve outcomes.

Refer to [Prompting Guidance](appendix/prompt-library/prompting-guidance.md) for details on how to write effective prompts.

### Test-and-Learn Approach

Rather than lengthy iterations, experiment and test ideas quickly. This mindset enables creative exploration without over-commitment. The insights you gain often exceed the value of the code produced.

### Evolving Best Practices

This playbook captures current best practices, acknowledging they will evolve rapidly. Embrace this constant change as an opportunity for growth.
