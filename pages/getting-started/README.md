# Getting Started

This section explains the core concepts of working with AI tools.

**Important:** You must only use AI tools from the [Defra Approved Tools](../appendix/defra-approved-tools.md) list. 

**Important:** You must enable privacy settings to protect government data. Privacy settings stop your code and data being stored on AI providers' servers. They also prevent your data being used to train AI models.

For information on the appropriate privacy settings for your chosen AI tool, see the [Defra Tools Guidance](https://defra.github.io/ai-sdlc-tool-guidance/)

## Workflow Steps
1. [Workflow](workflow.md) - An overview of the AI development workflow
2. [The Four Pillars](the-four-pillars.md) - The foundations of consistent code generation
3. [Mindset](ai-working-mindset.md) - The mindset you need to work with AI effectively
4. [Project Setup](project-setup.md) - Set up the foundational elements for your project, making sure all necessary files, tools, and conventions are in place
