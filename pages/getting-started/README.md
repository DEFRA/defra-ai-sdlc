# Getting Started

This section explains the core concepts of working with AI tools.

**Important:** You must only use AI tools from the [Defra Approved Tools](../appendix/defra-approved-tools.md) list. 

**Important:** You must configure proper privacy settings as outlined in the [Project Setup](project-setup.md) section. This keeps your sensitive information safe when working with AI tools.

## Workflow Steps
1. [Workflow](workflow.md) - An overview of the AI development workflow
2. [The Four Pillars](the-four-pillars.md) - The foundations of consistent code generation
3. [Mindset](ai-working-mindset.md) - The mindset you need to work with AI effectively
4. [Project Setup](project-setup.md) - Set up the foundational elements for your project, making sure all necessary files, tools, and conventions are in place
