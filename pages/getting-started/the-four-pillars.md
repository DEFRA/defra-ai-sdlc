# The Four Pillars

To generate consistent code, four elements must come together as shown in this diagram:

## The Four Elements

### 1. Clear Requirements

**Purpose:** Defines (with detail and clarity) the functional and pseudo-technical requirements for the product or service idea you want to implement.

**Where created:** Use an advanced "thinking" chat model like Claude or ChatGPT.

**Ref:** [Product Requirements Workflow](../feature-development/product-requirements.md)

### 2. Good Prompts

**Purpose:** The clear, detailed ask for a given task. It can refer to the IDE rules and the requirements. However, you don't need to repeat what's in the rules or requirements in the prompt.

**Where created:** Create prompts manually at first but then refine them using a chat model like Claude or ChatGPT.

**Ref:** Prompt engineering and meta prompting is explained further in the [Prompting Guidance](../appendix/prompt-library/prompting-guidance.md)

### 3. Rules for AI

**Purpose:** AI Rules define consistent and repeatable standards, patterns and conventions across your codebase.

**Where created:** Rule file formats are usually defined by the AI IDE tool. To help generate the rules themselves, use a chat model like Claude or ChatGPT.

**Ref**: [Rules for AI](../appendix/rules-for-ai)

### 4. Capable Code Generation Model

**Purpose:** Use the most capable LLM model for the task you are running to get good quality results. Not all tasks need advanced models, so select the most cost-effective model that can achieve the outcome you want.

**Where created:** The AI IDE tools typically let you select which model to use when prompting the LLM.
