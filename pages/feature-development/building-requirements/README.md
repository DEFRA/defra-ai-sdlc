# Building requirements

Creating effective product requirements forms the foundation for AI-assisted development. By adding constraints, you
increase predictability in a non-deterministic environment.

The more you fix requirements, the more consistent your results will be.

Think of this as **context engineering**. Documenting your expert knowledge in a way that AI tools can understand and
follow.

## Your workflow

While every team works differently, successful AI-assisted development requires these fundamentals:

1. **[Define your requirements](define-your-requirements.md)** - Capture everything you know about a feature
2. **[Document your constraints](document-your-constraints.md)** - Transform knowledge into precise, reviewable
   documentation
3. **[Design your interface](design-your-interface.md)** - Create clear interface requirements
4. **[Plan your delivery](plan-your-delivery.md)** - Break features into manageable tasks

## Time investment

You'll typically spend 30% or more of your workflow on requirements. This upfront investment dramatically improves the
efficiency and quality of AI-powered development.

## Key principles

**Iterate, don't perfect** - Use conversations with AI to refine documentation rather than aiming for perfection first
time.

**Accuracy matters** - Every error in documentation becomes a bug in code. Fix mistakes early when they're easy to
correct.

**Build incrementally** - Use each completed document as context for the next, creating a comprehensive picture.

Start with by capturing your initial feature knowledge.
