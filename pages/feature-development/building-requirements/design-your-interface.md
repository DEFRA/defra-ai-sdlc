# Design your interface

Create clear, GDS-compliant interface requirements that guide AI tools to build accessible, consistent user experiences.

Not every project requires detailed interface design. For API-only or backend services, you can skip
to [Plan your delivery](plan-your-delivery.md).

## Create interface mock-ups

Develop interface mockups using tools like Figma, Miro, or Mural. Take screenshots of each page and annotate clearly
expected behaviours - annotations must be visible to help the LLM understand interface requirements.

## Generate interface requirements

Transform your annotated mockups into detailed requirements that AI tools can implement.
Upload mockup screenshots and
use [prompt-user-interface-requirements](../appendix/prompt-library/product/prompt-user-interface-requirements.md) to
generate frontend requirements following GDS standards.
