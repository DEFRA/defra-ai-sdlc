# Feature Development

This section outlines a streamlined workflow for integrating AI into the software development lifecycle. The workflow focuses on discipline and good practices to deliver quality software for Defra.

**Important prerequisites:** 

- Complete the [Getting Started](../getting-started) section first
- Use only AI tools from the [Allowed Tools for Defra Pilot](../appendix/defra-approved-tools.md) list
- Configure proper privacy settings. This keeps your sensitive information safe when working with AI tools. For information on the appropriate privacy settings for your chosen AI tool, see the [Defra Tools Guidance](https://defra.github.io/ai-sdlc-tool-guidance/)
