# Feature Development

This section outlines a streamlined workflow for integrating AI into the software development lifecycle. The workflow focuses on discipline and good practices to deliver quality software for Defra.

**Important prerequisites:** 

- Complete the [Getting Started](../getting-started) section first
- Configure proper privacy settings as outlined in the [Project Setup](../getting-started/project-setup.md) section. This keeps your sensitive information safe when working with AI tools

## Workflow Steps
1. [Product Requirements](product-requirements.md) - Create clear and concise requirements for the feature using AI tools to draft and refine
2. [Development](development.md) - Develop the solution iteratively, using AI for implementation
3. [Testing](testing.md) - Unit, functional and end-to-end testing
4. [Refactoring](refactoring.md) - Refactor once feature complete
5. [Documentation](documentation.md) - Update all relevant documentation to reflect changes, ensuring clarity and alignment with project goals. Use documentation to give feedback to the AI tools for future iterations
