# AI Development Workflow

This section outlines a streamlined workflow for integrating AI into the development lifecycle. The workflow ensures a consistent approach to developing, testing, and refining AI-driven solutions.

By following this workflow, teams can efficiently integrate AI into their development processes, ensuring high-quality results, maintainable code, and streamlined operations. The workflow emphasizes iteration, validation, and continuous learning to maximize AI's potential in the SDLC.

**Important prerequisite:** You should have already completed the [Getting Started](../getting-started). It is crucial that you have configured proper privacy settings as outlined in the [Project Setup](../getting-started/project-setup.md) section. This keeps your sensitive information safe when working with AI tools.

## Workflow Steps
1. [Product Requirements](product-requirements.md) - Establish clear and concise requirements for the feature using AI tools to draft and refine.
2. [Development](development.md) - Develop the solution iteratively, leveraging AI for implementation.
3. [Testing](testing.md) - Unit, Functional and End to End testing
4. [Refactoring](refactoring.md) - Refactor once feature complete.
5. [Documentation](documentation.md) - Update all relevant documentation to reflect changes, ensuring clarity and alignment with project goals.  Documentation is then used to feedback to the AI tools for future iterations.
