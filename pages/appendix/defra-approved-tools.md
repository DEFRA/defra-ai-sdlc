# Allowed Tools for Defra Pilot

Use only AI tools from the [Defra Tools Guidance](https://defra.github.io/ai-sdlc-tool-guidance/){:target="_blank"}. This guidance lists vetted tools for the Defra AI pilot.

## Why we have allowed tools

Using allowed tools ensures:
- your work meets government security standards
- data protection requirements are met
- tools work effectively within Defra's technical environment

## Request a new tool

To use an AI tool not listed in the guidance:

1. Contact the AI Capabilities and Enablement team before using any unlisted tool. Find contact details [here](../../README.md)
2. Explain why you need the specific tool
3. Wait for approval before proceeding

The team will assess the tool against Defra's security and compliance requirements.

## MCP servers

MCP is currently under review and limited to designated pilot projects. If your project is approved to use MCP, see the [Defra MCP Guidance](defra-mcp-guidance.md) for approved servers and security requirements.
