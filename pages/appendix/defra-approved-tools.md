# Defra Approved Tools

Only use AI tools that appear in the [Defra Tools Guidance](https://defra.github.io/ai-sdlc-tool-guidance/){:target="_blank"}. This guidance contains vetted and approved tools for use across Defra.

## Why we have approved tools

Using approved tools helps make sure:
- compliance with government security standards
- data protection requirements are met
- tools work effectively within Defra's technical environment

## Request a new tool

If you need to use an AI tool not listed in the guidance:

1. Contact the AI Capabilities and Enablement team before using any unapproved tool. You can find contact details [here](../../README.md)
2. Provide details about why you need the specific tool
3. Wait for approval before proceeding

The team will assess the tool against Defra's security and compliance requirements.
