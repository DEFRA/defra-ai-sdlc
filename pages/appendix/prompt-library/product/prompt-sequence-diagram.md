# Sequence Diagram
````
# Context

You are tasked with creating a sequence diagram based on product requirements and system component descriptions.
## Detailed Feature Description

_Attach the output from example-product-requirements-input_

## System Architecture

_Attach the output from prompt-high-level-architecture_

## Data Model

_Attach the output from prompt-data-model-generation_

## Additional Information

_Add additional information to constrain your diagram generation. E.g._
- *Known side effects that must happen*
- *Unwanted behaviours to avoid*
- *Nuanced preferences for implementation details*

# Analysis Phase

1. Read, analyse and understand the requirements and diagrams attached.
2. Identify relationships. Map how components interact and communicate.
3. Trace data flow. Visualise how data moves through the system.
4. Determine boundaries. Identify service boundaries, external dependencies, and integration points.

# Output

Create a sequence diagram that describes this system.

Include all interaction points between services and any significant failure scenarios.

Output using MermaidJS syntax.
