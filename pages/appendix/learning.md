# AI Working Mindset

### Embrace the Fun and Creativity of AI

Working with AI tools combines productivity with creativity. Teams can rapidly develop production-quality features in novel ways, driving continuous exploration and innovation.

The learning curve requires adapting beyond traditional development mindsets to effectively orchestrate LLMs.

### A Generalist Approach to Collaboration

AI development shifts from role-based workflows to a generalist mindset. Team members must be versatile across product, design, development and testing. While domain expertise remains valuable, adaptability across disciplines is essential for accelerated AI-driven development.

### Managing Cognitive Load

AI tools present unique challenges:
- High cognitive load from rapid experimentation
- Frequent context switching
- Risk of change fatigue

Mitigate these through:
- Regular pairing sessions
- Structured breaks
- Clear priorities
- Supportive team culture

### Keeping Current

The AI ecosystem evolves rapidly with daily updates to models, IDEs, and services. Dedicate time to track developments and maintain continuous learning. This research time can provide valuable breaks from intensive development.

### Effective Prompting

Clear communication with LLMs is essential. Treat them as capable junior developers needing explicit requirements. Well-crafted prompts yield better results. Iiterate on prompts to optimise outcomes.

Refer to [Prompting Guidance](prompt-library/prompting-guidance.md) for details on how to write effective prompts.

### Test-and-Learn Approach

Rather than lengthy iterations, experiment and test ideas quickly. This mindset enables creative exploration without over-commitment. The insights gained often exceed the value of the code produced.

### Evolving Best Practices

This playbook captures current best practices, acknowledging they may evolve rapidly. Embrace this constant change as an opportunity for growth.
