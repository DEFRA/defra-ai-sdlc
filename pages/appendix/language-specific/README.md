# Language-specific resources

This section provides resources for specific programming languages used within Defra. Each language section includes Rules for AI to help you write code that meets Defra's development standards. We update this section regularly to reflect the latest guidelines and improvements. Check back frequently to stay up to date with recent changes.

## Rules for AI

Most Artificial Intelligence Coding Assistants (AICAs) have the concept of rules for AI. 

For Cusor, the documentation can be found at https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules

Some examples of rules for the programming languages and standards used within Defra are given below.
