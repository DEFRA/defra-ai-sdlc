# Product requirements

Capture what you need to build and how users will interact with it. Pick the techniques that work for your team and
project.

## Capture your feature knowledge

Start by writing down everything you know about the feature. Don't worry about structure or polish, just get it written
down.

Include whatever's relevant:

- Feature purpose and overview
- Frontend and backend needs
- Business rules and edge cases
- Your preferred approach
- Security considerations

See [example-product-requirements-input](../../appendix/prompt-library/product/example-product-requirements-input.md)
for a template.

## Design interfaces (if needed)

For user-facing features, create mockups in Figma, Miro, or similar tools. Add clear annotations explaining expected
behaviours.

Transform mockups into detailed requirements
using [prompt-user-interface-requirements](../../appendix/prompt-library/product/prompt-user-interface-requirements.md)
to ensure GDS compliance.

## Plan your delivery

Break features into manageable pieces that AI tools can implement effectively.

### Product Requirements Doc

Consider formalising your feature into a Product Requirements
Document [prompt-product-requirements-document](../../appendix/prompt-library/product/prompt-product-requirements-document.md)

### Create user stories

Right-sized stories should:

- Complete meaningful functionality
- Have clear acceptance criteria
- Include implementation context
- Be easy to verify

Use [prompt-user-story-creation](../../appendix/prompt-library/product/prompt-user-story-creation.md) with your
requirements and architecture as context.

### Adapt to your process

Every team works differently. Adjust story formats to match your existing workflow, or break your team's existing
stories into more granular implementation tasks.

## Working effectively

You have solid product requirements when:

- Feature knowledge is documented
- Architecture is visualised
- Interface needs are clear (if applicable)
- Stories have acceptance criteria
- Your team understands the approach

**Review with your team** - Multiple perspectives spot issues and ensure shared understanding.
