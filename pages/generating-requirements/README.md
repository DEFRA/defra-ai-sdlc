# Generating requirements

AI models deliver better results when you give them clear boundaries. Product requirements, user stories, data models and workflows channel AI outputs into useful, predictable patterns.

Think of this as context engineering - the more precise your requirements, the more reliable your AI-assisted development becomes.

## Pick your approach

Every team works differently. Choose what fits your needs:

**[Product requirements](product-requirements.md)** - Capture features, business logic and generate user stories

**[Technical requirements](technical-requirements.md)** - Document architecture, data models, APIs, etc

You might use both, or just one. Start wherever makes sense for your team.

## Time investment

Teams typically spend 30% or more of project time on requirements. This upfront work improves development speed and
quality.

## When you're ready

Move to development when:

- All behaviours, designs and interactions are documented
- Data models accurately represent your solution
- Architecture and technical constraints are documented
- Your team has reviewed and approved the approach
