# Generating Requirements

As per [the four pillars](../getting-started/the-four-pillars.md), AI Coding Assistants (AICA) deliver high quality results when you provide clear requirements.

## What You'll Achieve

This section helps you use AI tools like AI Assistants to create comprehensive requirements for your projects.

Requirements vary widely depending on your situation, for example a brand new greenfield application, or changes to existing live legacy services.

AI can help you with both requirement **generation** and **ideation**, giving you fresh perspectives and approaches you might not have considered.

## Types of Requirements

We split requirements into two main categories, both of which are necessary for AI Coding Assistants (AICA) to deliver high quality code:

<div class="tile-container">
  <a href="product-requirements" class="tile-link">
    <div class="tile">
      <h3>Product Requirements</h3>
      <p>Functional artefacts like user stories and acceptance criteria that define what the system should do</p>
    </div>
  </a>
  <a href="technical-requirements" class="tile-link">
    <div class="tile">
      <h3>Technical Requirements</h3>
      <p>Technical artefacts including data models, APIs and architecture diagrams that define how the system should work</p>
    </div>
  </a>
</div>
