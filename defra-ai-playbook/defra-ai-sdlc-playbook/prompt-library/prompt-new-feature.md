An example for starting a new feature on a new branch. Use a new context window. 

Context: the PRD file (note the '@' notation to refer to a specific file in the IDE):

```
Read and understand @prd-file. For now, please implement [Section Number & name] only. Do not implement features from any other section.

This is an additonal feature to the current codebase. Examine the whole of the codebase and follow the conventions and standards that are already implemented.

***Important*** Take your time, think step by step and make a plan of action before implementing this feature. 
```
