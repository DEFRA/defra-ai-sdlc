```
Review the updated codebase and update the documentation. 

Keep the structure and format of the existing documentation, but add additional content or change existing content as required.  Include updated data models in the documentation in addition to the other updates.

Make content concise but informative. Make the tone professional. Use British English 

Documentation to updates includes:
@README.md 
@ARCHITECTURE.md 

**Important:** Provide the document as a single, complete snippet that satisfies all requirements on the first try. Do not provide multiple revisions or partialâ€”just the single final version. If you need to reason internally, do so silently.
