# AI Working Mindset

### Embrace the Fun and Creativity of AI

Working with AI tools and techniques to build things is not just productive - it’s exhilarating. There’s a unique thrill in developing new, production-quality features rapidly and seeing ideas come to life in ways that weren’t possible before. This sense of accomplishment can be highly addictive, driving teams to continuously explore new possibilities.

It does come with a learning curve however, as figuring out how best to orchestrate the 
LLM is not an exact science and working with a non-AI coding mindset will likely result in trouble.
### A Generalist Approach to Collaboration

AI development demands a shift from traditional, role-based workflows to a generalist mindset. Every team member needs to wear multiple hats - from product management and design to development and testing. Working with AI tools often feels more like orchestrating capabilities than adhering to strict, predefined roles. Although you may still have specific domain knowledge in certain areas which will be of values, having flexibility and adaptability to work across multiple disciplines are key when AI tooling can speed you up so much.

### Managing Cognitive Load and Preventing Change Fatigue

The speed at which you can progress development with AI tools comes with its own set of challenges:
The high cognitive load of rapid experimentation, continuous learning and context switching due to speed can lead to change fatigue if not managed properly. 
Pairing, taking regular breaks, maintaining clear priorities, and fostering a supportive team environment are critical. 
It’s important to appreciate the groundbreaking capabilities of these tools while maintaining perspective and patience, especially when things don’t work as expected the first time.

### Keeping Up with the Current Landscape

The AI ecosystem evolves at lightning speed. Models, IDEs, libraries, and cloud services are updated or released almost daily. 
Staying current with the latest advancements is a daunting but necessary task. Teams should consider dedicating time and resources to tracking industry developments and adopting a mindset of continuous learning.
This can also assist with the mental fatigue aspect as research is more slow paced and free form than developing features.

### Clear Communication and Prompt Engineering

To working effectively with large language models (LLMs), requires clear and deliberate communication via prompting. 
Treat these tools like a talented junior developer, in that you need to be explicit about your requirements and goals.
A poorly crafted prompts lead to subpar results due to the myriad of ways it could be interpreted. Taking frequent breaks and approaching prompting with a fresh mind can improve outcomes. You can always revert your changes and iterate on the prompting too to dial in the LLM. 
While the tools’ limitations can be frustrating, it’s essential to focus on the extraordinary progress they represent - just keep in mind that you need to be direct and specific to achieve results at the present.

### Adopting a Test-and-Learn Mindset

AI tools encourage a shift in development philosophy. Instead of iterating endlessly on a single approach, it’s often more effective to experiment, test, and discard ideas quickly. This true test-and-learn mindset can be liberating, allowing teams to explore creative solutions without becoming overly attached to any single idea. Remember that the insight you gain from your experimentation is often far more valuable than the code you write during your experimentation. Flexibility and willingness to adapt are the foundations of effective AI-driven workflows.

### Recognising the Temporary Nature of Best Practices

The techniques outlined in this playbook represent a snapshot in time. The rapid evolution of AI means that many best practices will become outdated within weeks or months. Viewing this constant change as an opportunity rather than a challenge can help teams stay motivated and open to new possibilities.

### Acknowledging the Trajectory of Improvement

Remember, today’s AI tools are the least capable they will ever be. The pace of advancement ensures that they will only get better over time. Teams should lean into this trajectory, leveraging the tools as they are now while keeping an eye on the horizon for what comes next.
