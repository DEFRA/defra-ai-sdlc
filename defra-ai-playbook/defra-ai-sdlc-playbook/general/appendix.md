## What is AI and LLMs and how do they work?
- todo
### Core Concepts
* **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Advanced AI systems trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like text responses
* **Data Training**: The process of feeding large datasets to AI models to help them learn patterns, relationships, and generate appropriate outputs
* **RAG vs Finetune**: Comparison between Retrieval-Augmented Generation (adding context dynamically) and fine-tuning (specialized model training)
* **Agents / Agentic AI**: AI systems capable of taking autonomous actions based on objectives and context
### Considerations
* **Pros and Cons**: Detailed analysis of benefits and limitations when implementing AI solutions
* **Environmental Impact**: Assessment of computational resources and energy consumption in AI operations

- something about using temperature of 0, context windows when calling llms

**Licensing**

other stuff
- **Demonstrations**: Practical examples of AI implementation
* **Proof of Concepts**: Documented trials and experiments
