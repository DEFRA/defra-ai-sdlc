# AI Development Workflow

This section outlines a streamlined workflow for integrating AI into the development lifecycle. The workflow ensures a consistent approach to developing, testing, and refining AI-driven solutions.

By following this workflow, teams can efficiently integrate AI into their development processes, ensuring high-quality results, maintainable code, and streamlined operations. The workflow emphasizes iteration, validation, and continuous learning to maximize AI's potential in the SDLC.

## Workflow Steps

1. **[[workflow-project-setup|Project Setup]]** - Define the foundational elements for the project, ensuring all necessary files, tools, and conventions are in place.
2. **Feature Development Lifecycle**
	1. [[workflow-product-requirements|Product Requirements]] - Establish clear and concise requirements for the feature using AI tools to draft and refine.
	2. [[workflow-development-and-testing|Development and Testing]] - Develop the solution iteratively, leveraging AI for implementation, testing, and validation. Refactor once feature complete.
	3. [[workflow-documentation-feedback|Documentation and Feedback]] - Update all relevant documentation to reflect changes, ensuring clarity and alignment with project goals.  Documentation is then used to feedback to the AI tools for future iterations.
