# 1 - Welcome to the Defra AI SDLC Playbook

Version 1.1

This playbook offers hands-on guidance for integrating AI into the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), specifically tailored to Defra’s needs. Rather than theoretical concepts, you’ll find practical techniques, real-world examples, and step-by-step tutorials ready for immediate use in your projects. It’s a living document—continuously updated with insights and improvements from developers like you.

By following this playbook, you’ll learn how to:

* Streamline routine development tasks and free up time for creative problem-solving
* Build more robust, maintainable applications using AI-assisted methods
* Facilitate cross-departmental collaboration through integrated systems

The focus remains on practical, proven techniques rather than theoretical concepts—offering tangible solutions for government software development challenges.

## Who This Playbook Is For

This guide is built for developers with some experience who’ve dabbled in AI tools like ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot and are ready to explore further. If you've asked ChatGPT for code snippets or installed Cursor but mostly use its autocomplete, this playbook will help you go deeper. It's for curious, hands-on developers eager to get more out of these tools—without getting lost in AI jargon or hype.

## New to AI Tools? Start Here

If you feel overwhelmed by AI terminology or you’re just getting started:

1. **Begin with ChatGPT**: Create a free account at [Chat GPT](https://chat.openai.com) and try asking simple coding questions
2. **Install Cursor**: Download this AI-powered code editor at [Cursor](https://cursor.so) to experience real-time AI support as you code.
3. **Return to this guide**: Once you've had some hands-on experience with these tools, this playbook will help you use them more effectively
