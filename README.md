## Overview

Defra manages environmental protection, food production and rural development across the UK. The department works through multiple sub-departments and arms-length bodies, each with different roles and ways of working.

Defra's size and complexity create opportunities to use AI throughout software development. This playbook helps you use these opportunities through practical methods, tools and techniques. You'll get actionable guidance to use AI effectively. This leads to lower development costs, faster service delivery and better operational efficiency. You can innovate while making sure Defra's operations meet their goals sustainably.
