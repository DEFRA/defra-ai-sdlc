## Overview

Defra manages environmental protection, food production and rural development across the UK. The department works through multiple sub-departments and arms-length bodies. Each has different roles and ways of working.

Defra's size and complexity create opportunities to use AI throughout software development. This playbook helps you use these opportunities through practical methods, tools and techniques.
