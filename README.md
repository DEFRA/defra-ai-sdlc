# Welcome to the Defra AI SDLC Playbook
Version 1.1

## Intro

Ever wished you could spend less time on repetitive coding tasks and more time solving interesting problems? This playbook offers hands-on guidance for integrating AI into the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), specifically tailored to Defra’s needs.

Here you'll find practical techniques, code examples, and step-by-step guides to help guide you on your journey to using AI tools, whilst ensuring Defra’s diverse operations can meet their objectives sustainably.

## What you'll learn

By using this playbook, you'll discover how to:

* Cut through routine development tasks in half the time
* Build more reliable, maintainable code with AI assistance
* Work more effectively with colleagues across departments
* Know exactly when (and when not) to use AI in your workflow

## Who this playbook is for

If you've tried asking ChatGPT for code snippets or installed Cursor but mostly use it for autocomplete, you're in the right place. This guide is for people who:

* Have some coding experience but are new to AI-assisted development
* Want practical examples, not AI jargon or theory
* Are curious about getting more from AI tools but not sure where to start
* Need guidance that works in government development environments
